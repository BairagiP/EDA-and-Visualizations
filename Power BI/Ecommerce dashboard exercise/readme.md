# E-commerce Dataset Dashboard  

## **Overview**  
This project involves analyzing an e-commerce dataset and building a comprehensive dashboard using a preferred tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries). The goal is to create a data narrative that highlights key insights and trends within the dataset.  

---

## **Objectives**  
1. **Data Narrative**  
   - Develop a coherent story around the dataset provided, emphasizing meaningful insights.  

2. **Key Trends Analysis**  
   - **Monthly Sales**:  
     - Identify what products are selling well and what aren't.  
     - Analyze customer behavior and uncover trends in product preferences.  
     - Investigate insights on shipment and order types.  
   - **Retention Rates**:  
     - Calculate and analyze customer retention rates.  
     - Provide actionable recommendations based on retention insights (bonus for detailed analysis).  

---

## **Key Questions Addressed**  
- What products are performing well, and which ones need improvement?  
- Are there any noticeable trends in customer purchases?  
- What are the patterns in shipment types and order characteristics?  
- How does the retention rate look, and what factors influence it?
